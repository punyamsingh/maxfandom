## 2. JON KENT: DESTINY (`https://maxfandom.netlify.app/blogs/jon-kent-destiny`)

Jon Kent: Destiny – Fortress Of Insights

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/jon-kent.jpg)

My first blog is about the world’s first comic book superhero and his son. Technically, Superman should now be 81 years old, but he is still treated as if he is in his mid 30s. Every major comic book company has faced this problem. Eventually, their readers start demanding more. Stories can no longer just be a good guy beating the bad guy. Everything should make more sense. Stories should be closer to reality even if they won’t be the same. People want to see growth in their heroes. They want to imagine a world that may feel like their own and still be full of heroes.

DC has been slowly trying to do this from the last 20 years when Clark Kent turned 60. Fans wanted a change in Clark Kent-Lois Lane romance, so DC married them. Questions of Clark’s age started arising so DC rebooted their whole universe. If the fans of the genre look closely, the stories of Death Of Superman, New 52 and DC Rebirth were all about making people open to changes regarding their biggest characters.

![](https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2016/03/9MEkW5ZS.jpg)

One day, Clark Kent has to die. This will be his final death. No resurrections this time. It needs to happen and fans will have to accept someone else as Superman. We may not like this change but for in a way it is necessary.

This has happened before. Alan Scott was the original Green Lantern but later when Hal Jordan gained more popularity as the Green Lantern, DC finally allowed Alan to get old and retire. He may still have adventures but the torch has been passed. As Fans we demand growth but we are seldom ready for change.Fans were not happy when Clark died and 3 replacements for Superman were introduced. Or when Bucky became Captain America in Marvel after Steve Rogers died. Change is harder when the income of a billion dollar industry is at stake. But that does not mean popular characters never see ground breaking changes. We accepted Miles Morales as Spider-Man, Jane Foster as Thor and most popularly Barry Allen as the Flash.

But maybe the case of Superman is different, DC has often explained how destruction of Krypton and death of the Waynes is the catalyst and foundation for all their stories. Maybe it is harder for DC fans to see someone else wear the symbol of House of El. And that is why DC is working on these changes in a much slower way. Making their stories more passionate and natural.

Jonathan Kent is an organic DC character. He was not born with purpose or story-arcs. He was born because of creative writing. When first introduced, he was a small child and he remained that way for more than a decade before his adventures started. We witnessed his childhood just the way we saw Clark’s. No one wanted a new Superman from Jon Kent at that time. And that worked. DC was working passionately with his father while we were watching a cute, innocent teenage boy learn how to fly. And that is how he became one of the very few characters to actually enjoy a childhood in comic books before they were called to save the world. No Robins or Shazam or titans or Power Pack ever got that.

![](https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Future-State-Justice-League-2-Variant.jpg?resize=674,1024)

Jon Kent is now older now but he still has much to learn. Every time a mantle is passed fans usually expect a better and more kick-ass version of the character. But maybe what we need is not so different from what we have. We saw Clark Kent fall for 80 years and for 80 years we have been seeing him get back up. He never loses hope or fails our expectations. We have seen him improve the way he fights, responds to a problem or settles an argument. I think we do not want to see Clark be replaced with someone perfect. We want someone who will fail and learn as we all do everyday. Maybe the next 80 years will not show us Jonathan Kent becoming the most powerful Kryptonian or being better than his father in every way. But I would love to see him follow a example and fail only to realize how to do better. Everyday.

In conclusion, Change is challenging for everyone. Many times we may wish to follow in the footsteps of people who succeeded in the past. But that won’t be growth or change for that matter. There are no recipes of success. Some mistakes are worth making. Don’t lose hope and take brave new steps.

Avengers Arena & Heroes In Crisis – Fortress Of Insights

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/avengers-arena.jpg?w=720)

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/heroes-in-crisis-1-1.jpg)

Blood was spilled. Lives were lost. And their world was never the same again.

In today’s post we are going to talk Avengers Arena (by Marvel comics) and Heroes In Crisis (by DC comics). I know these comics are nothing alike. They have so many differences. (this ain’t a DC vs Marvel article)

Today we are not comparing these two series. (Although Heroes In Crisis would clearly win). We are going to talk about the clever writing trick used in both of them. But first let’s talk about both these books a little.

[Avengers Arena (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Arena)

16 young adults with super-abilities are kidnapped from across the Marvel universe by [Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_(Marvel_Comics)) and stranded them on an isolated island to battle each other to death. Arcade is a super-villain who carries out his assassinations via various elaborate traps, often referred to as _[Murderworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderworld_(comics))_. Now, he has been making these deadly Murderworlds from years to kill superheroes but no one ever died in them. Yet. He created this arena to redeem his name in the criminal underworld and actually managed to kill many of his victims. All the adult super-heroes were unaware of the whereabouts of these kids until the plans finally ended the way Arcade wanted to. (or Mr.Arcade you can try building a few non-lethal amusement parks and earn Billions) (just spitballing here, sir)

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/arena-players-1.jpg)

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/0715b-rco022_1468986674.jpg)

Now let’s talk about the victims. 5 kids from [Avengers Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Academy), 2 [Runaways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaways_(comics)), 3 solo crusaders and 6 students from the newly introduced British superhero school Braddock Academy. These characters were picked by the writers for various reasons. Some were no longer as popular as they used to be. Some long forgotten ones were given a last chance. While, some of them needed to be tested in a harsh environment for the first time. But really the new characters from the Braddock Academy are the real heart-breakers. Some of them die when we least expect it. Each of them had emotional backstory the readers could connect to. The writers created new characters for this event, armed each of them with crazy powers and then sent them into battle to DIE!

(I mean if he is about to die in the next issue, can you please not tell me his totally awesome origin story)

Old friendships were broken. New alliances were formed. Overall this book was savage. It also highlighted the negligence, lack of guidance and supervision these kids received from the adult heroes of Marvel Universe (who at the time were busy fighting each other). Arcade uploads the events of the Arena on [YouTube](http://youtube.com/), proving himself as a formidable enemy who can no longer be ignored.

This book is must read for the fans of Marvel universe who want the taste of [Battle Royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(novel)) in Marvel. You don’t need to read anything before this to enjoy it. Or you can checkout Runaways. (rest all related ones are garbage)

[Heroes In Crisis (2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_in_Crisis)

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/harley-vs-booster-1-1.jpg)

More than a dozen heroes are dead. **[Harley Quinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn)** and [Booster Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_Gold) are the prime suspects. And the DC Trinity is on the case.

That is the beginning of this major crossover “Crisis” event that shook the DC superhero community to its core. If you wanted a series about a threat that would shake the DC world and ultimately cause its multiverse to reboot, this ain’t one of those. Its not about [Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman), [Wonder Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman) and [Batman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman) solving a murder-mystery case either. Its about heroes of a world working through their grief and trauma. Talking about the burden of the responsibilities taken and mistakes made along the way.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tjfSFtd.jpg)

It’s a concept which we may have seen many times over the years but we never really witnessed it like this before. We see each ex-Robin talk about how they don’t fit in the Bat family while ironically they do know where the others fit. We find [Donna Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Troy) explaining how her origin story does not make sense. Or how [Arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Harper_(character)) struggles to fight his drug addiction while leading the life of a vigilante.

![Blue and Gold (Heroes in Crisis) : comicbooks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwGYcVAU0AAj8Vd.jpg)

This is what this series was about. It’s about [Blue Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kord) risking everything to help his best-friend. It was about an ex-sidekick outsmarting the greatest detective and the fastest crime scene investigator in the world. It was about Harley Quinn handling herself against the DC Trinity. But most of all it was about [Wally West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_West).

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/wally-family-1.jpg?w=602&h=600)

A character DC simply erased along with his family after the New 52 relaunch. When he came back, everyone said he brought “Hope” with him. That is a huge burden to bear for someone who has lost all reasons to live. His wife does not recognize him. His children were never born. Just because he’s back doesn’t mean his life is.

This was the first time we saw some consequences of the DC reboots (especially [DC Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Rebirth)). The universe was rewritten and the only one paying the cost for it was Wally West.

Heroes In Crisis is a DC story everyone should read. Our heroes may put on brave faces when they face the threats. But that does not mean they don’t have their own demons. They are just like the rest of us – deeply flawed individuals who wake up every day trying to do better.

Wow, that was dark, right?

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/e7971-rco022_1468915180.jpg)

Anyway, now that we have discussed the two let’s talk about the clever writing trick I mentioned earlier.

If we take a look at the death casualties of these two events we will see that all the characters who died were not that famous. (with the possible exception of Roy Harper)

Looking at the cast of Avengers Arena, we see most of the characters do not have a significant fanbase. This event acted like a screening test for the characters. Maybe the characters of [Darkhawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkhawk), [Sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juston_Seyfert), etc. used to have a moderate popularity once but now they were practically invisible. So Marvel just wanted to let go of the deadweight. Also there were characters like [Nico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Minoru) [Minoru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Minoru) and [Chase Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Stein) who recently started to grow in popularity, so Marvel wanted to see their potential. This is an important step of the Marvel method. Promote only those characters which the fans love with all their heart. The rest can die to motivate the living heroes. Same old, same old.

DC also did the same thing essentially. If you want to make good murder mystery follow these steps:

1\. Collect a bunch of unpopular heroes, a few villains, maybe 2 or 3 well-known heroes and one ROY HARPER.

2\. Kill all. Be Savage. Make sure few survivors become prisoners of trauma and go MIA.

3\. Make sure the characters who are really-hard-to-kill appear dead for as long as possible. (looking at you poison ivy and wally)(wink)(wink)(sorry Roy- you gonna stay DEAD)

4\. Let all the drama pass over. The legacy of a good superhero is now maligned. (good job, DC)

5\. The Murderer survives the end of story along with all the popular characters. (except ….Roy)

6\. Wait for atleast 5 years, 2 Crises and hundreds of angry fan letters before bringing back the only person-of-interest in the whole event who died and we mourned.

ROY HARPER LIVES! (He came back in [Infinite Frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Frontier) (2021) #1)

In conclusion, no one important or popular ever really dies in our comics. popular). Then you may ask why do we care about these stories where death doesn't matter. where suffering or adversity is more often than not an illusion. Simple. Because of everything else that's never an illusion. Our heroes and their morals stay true even on there darkest days. Pain and suffering is no excuse to abandon your guiding ideals.

Who said comicbooks can't teach you anything. with that said, i'll be back next time with more insights in the comic book world. See you all next time.

I thought a lot about today’s post before posting it. I wanted to tell the story of a legendary character whose goodness inspires us. But instead I decided to talk about someone who is not a legend. I am not going to tell tales of nobleness or something pure like that.

No, I am talking about a character who is underrated and underappreciated. He doesn’t even make the list of top 100 greatest heroes. And he never will be anyone’s favorite.

So why am I going to talk him?

Because his struggles are worth mentioning.

Today, I am going to talk about . . . [Black Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(Dane_Whitman)).

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/black-knight-3-1.png?w=448)

You are dissapointed, right? 🤔

I wrote a nice first para. Maybe even managed to get your attention. But I don’t think anyone can ever hear the name ‘Black Knight’ and become interested. So you are somewhat disappointed, right?

I mean the world already has a Batman The Dark Knight and we can already assume the kind of niche the word “Knight” belongs to. Slay the dragons, serve the king, honor, swords and armour and so on. Well, if you want the first impression I can give that to you. You won’t be swept off your feet. But here it is. (keep reading the rest of the post only if you want to know what I was talking about in the intro)

The first Black night ( [Sir Percy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(Sir_Percy))) was a member of the court of [King Arthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur). He wielded the [Ebony Blade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(Marvel_Comics)#Ebony_Blade) – a cursed sword which was powered by the darkness in the heart of its wielder. Sir Percy used the sword for noble causes until eventually the sword drove him mad. Then for centuries the Ebony Blade exchanged many hands. But everyone who used it eventually succumbed to the sword’s dark power. Until Sir Percy’s descendant in the present day, Dane Whitman came upon the Blade. Dane decided to use the sword as a hero and redeem the title of Black Knight. He had many adventures after that with Avengers and other superhero teams. He sometimes takes guidance from the ghost of [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_in_comics#Marvel_Comics) about the sword. Even Dane has succumbed to madness and rage before but was eventually able to gain control. Avengers have now distanced themselves from Black Knight after declaring him mad and addicted to the sword.

Black Knight will gets its live-action debut in the upcoming [Eternals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternals_(film)) (2021) movie. [Kit Harrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Harington) will play the role of Dane Whitman.

And that was everything someone who is not very interested in this character should know before watching _Eternals._

If you are still reading then I assume you are one of those people who believe that there is more to this character. Come explore with me.

**Mjolnir and Ebony Blade**

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/mjolnir-and-ebony-blade.jpg)

When the Ebony Blade was first introduced, people often used to compare it with [Mjolnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mjolnir_(comics)). Mjolnir is a very judgmental weapon. It discriminates people on the basis of their worthiness (which is a very vague concept). Similarly, Ebony Blade is a picky weapon too. I mean anyone can hold it, even use it in battle. But only a few people can operate it to its mightiest potential. But you see there is a big difference. For years Marvel comics made us believe Dane Whitman was able to unleash the power of the Ebony Blade because he was pure of heart. But recently in the event [King In Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_Black) (2020-21) it was revealed by [Knull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knull_(character)), the god of abyss that everyone had it wrong. The sword was not looking for the ones pure of heart, it was waiting for the ones impure of heart. This meant Sir Percy and Dane Whitman were men filled with darkness of their own. The sword was simply channeling that darkness.

Well when I read that, I said **BULLSHIT**!

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/1a353-rco021_1612371454.jpg)

Knull claimed that King Arthur’s court was filled with noble warriors and honourable men. Finding a man pure of heart there was never a problem. But this particular sword was waiting for someone impure of heart.

And that is where I raise my point. Sir Percy was not the noblest man in Camelot. But he was definitely not the only one with darkness in heart. So why was he chosen?

I believe Knull was wrong. I believe Ebony Blade is much more picky than Mjolnir. If you are looking for someone with darkness in heart, the obvious answer is to look for the villains. But this sword sought out heroes. Sir Percy and Dane Whitman.

So yeah, I think what this sword wanted someone who not only is impure of heart but also someone who is determined to overcome it for the greater good. Now the last statement is not what the writers at Marvel wanted to convey. It’s what I believe.

**The Curse**

Now I want to talk about the Curse Of The Ebony Blade. Once again let me first tell you what is written in comics. It is well established in comics that the sword is cursed. Once it tastes blood, it can make its wielder go mad with rage and cause carnage. Anyone using the sword is eventually corrupted with darkness. Even [Captain America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America) was not able to control himself. The only person who ever has is Dane Whitman. It wasn’t easy for him. It never will be.

Every time the Black Knight uses the sword he can feel the darkness. Speaking to him, trying to corrupt him, every waking moment. This is a struggle no one else can witness. The [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)) once declared him mentally unfit to be a hero and tried to take the sword from him. Well that did not end well for the Avengers. Or Black Knight for that matter. Suffice to say, other heroes have distanced themselves from him since then.

**The Responsibility**

If the sword corrupts him, then why? If the sword amplifies his inner darkness, then why? If he can drop the sword and find light with a better life, then why? Why, in name of god, Dane Whitman does still use the Ebony Blade? He can give it up and be a better hero. Live a life with his friends. Find some peace. Maybe snuff out the darkness in his heart with the light of hope. Why? Why does a man choose to live with darkness for every moment of his life?

Well I think that is another reason why Ebony Blade chose him. Selfless. To the extreme. I didn’t know Black Knight well before I read the 5-issue run of Black Knight (2015-16). Destiny to be damned. Dane came from a long line of Black Knights. Everyone of them was destined to be damned. I don’t know what each of them did. I don’t know why the last two predecessors of Dane became villains. But I do know what Dane Whitman did. He faught. For freedom and redemption.

The sword does not make the man. Dane was a skilled swordsman, trained fighter and a gifted scientist. Living without the Blade was very peaceful for him. But if he is not using that sword, that means the sword is calling to someone else. Corrupting someone else. Another person will go through what the Black Knights suffered for centuries. Is that fair?

Well, someone somewhere in the world right now is committing insufferable crimes to someone else. You didn’t save them. Is that fair? No. It is not. But it was never a duty for you to play hero. And that is why it’s not your fault.

Selfless to the extreme. Take the suffering of everyone else upon yourself. That is Dane Whitman. Anyone else who uses that sword **will** go mad and turn into a berserker and Dane Whitman won’t be able to live with himself knowing someone else is facing damnation because he chose to enjoy his life. This is why his struggles are worth noticing. He would rather damn himself than let anyone suffer.

No love. No praise. No recognition. No friends or brotherhood. There will be no victory rewards. No consolation in the dark. Only a knight of valor acting selfless in the face of Armageddon. His path is hard and full of troubles. He walks nonetheless.

> _As long as the Black Blade blazes darkly in my hand, I must fight on… No matter what the cost!_
>
> – Dane Whitman

## 5. JASON TODD: ROBIN DESTROYED! (`https://maxfandom.netlify.app/blogs/jason-todd-robin-destroyed`)

Jason Todd: Robin Destroyed! – Fortress Of Insights

Do you ever wonder what will they say when they write the story of your life?

Did you live up to your potential?

Or did Destiny pass you by?

I tried four different ways to start talking about Jason Todd. All of them sounded brave and innocent. Mysterious filled with the right amount of impulsive. Nah.

If you are here to see a Boy Wonder become the greatest hero alive, **you got the wrong Robin!**

This ain’t the story of “ascension into greatness” or “journey of redemption”.

This is the story of an innocent boy’s **Fall Into Darkness**.

**Warning: Do not get attached. No one in their right mind should ever admire Jason Todd. He’s a murderer!**

Good thing I am never in my right mind when it comes to DC.

Denying the darkness in him is denying the pain and suffering he has endured. And I won’t do that to Jason Todd. Not today. Not ever.

I have read all about Jason Todd. All the versions. Good and Bad. The story is a tragedy, a sad one through and through. It broke my heart and made me cry. Because when it comes to Jason the real bad guys are the comic book fans.

Before I can explain why I said that, I wanna tell you the tragic story of Jason Todd that every comic-book fan capable of sympathy should know. But if you are not the **real deal** and you are reading this post without hunger for amazement, then you should not pain yourself and just read the next part to find out every highlight about Jason Todd and leave. You can’t handle the whole truth.

The original Robin – Dick Grayson was trying to grow from being **Robin** – ‘Boy Wonder’ to **Nightwing**– ‘The Titan’. When Dick left, Batman comics became boring. DC decided to reinvent Robin with a new character.

Before meeting Batman, Jason Todd was an orphan who was surviving on the streets on his own. He once tried to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Bruce Wayne put him in a school that later turned out to be a school for criminals. The new duo took down the evil school together.

Jason started living in Wayne Manor and eventually became Robin. Fans despised him. A lot. DC fans said Jason Todd became a carbon copy of Dick. They decided to let Joker beat him to death with a crowbar.

Batman cried for a year and then replaced his son with a new one (Tim Drake). 17 years later in 2005, DC brought him back from death as the new murderous vigilante Red Hood. For most of the next decade, Jason Todd was shown as a villain who used to be a hero. DC let him fall to the dark side.

Then finally after DC Rebirth, Red Hood was presented as an anti-villain. Batman started trying to mend their relationship. This is still happening in comics. Everyone in Bat-family either hates him or feels pity for him.

He’s badass. and ruthless. and awesome.

Jason Todd made his first live-action debut in the Titans (2018) series played by Curran Walters. He will take the identity of Red Hood in the upcoming season 3.

If you are still reading, then I am going to tell you how DC gambled away the life of a character.

**THE VOTE**

The year was 1983, **Dick Grayson** was getting popular in the Titans and DC wanted him to step out of Batman’s shadow. But without Robin, Batman comics were not getting the same response because the Dark Knight is a silent brooding character. If left alone he can spend days without saying anything which can make a comic essentially lose its voice. This is the real reason why DC decided to reinvent a new robin to accompany Batman. Within months after Jason Todd’s introduction, he fully transitioned into Robin.

**Fans didn’t appreciate that now, did they?**

Oh, they were furious. Many fans saw Todd as a usurper of Robin’s legacy and hated him for it. Others felt that he was turning into a carbon-copy of Dick. They both even had the same photocopy origin story. In fact, very few fans were enjoying the introduction of Todd.

Well, DC swallowed the hate-mail for a long time. That was until **Dennis O’Neil**(Batman editor since 1986) came up with the ground-breaking idea for ‘ **A Death in the Family**‘ in 1988. He thought that the fans would like to influence the creative decisions taken by the writers. He wanted to perform a big stunt where the stakes would be actual life and death for a character. And Jason Todd was the obvious choice because of his large unpopularity. DC was not sure what to do with him, so they presented the choice in front of readers as a telephone vote.

**Vote for Jason Todd’s Survival or Death !!** If he lives DC would have redeemed the image of the new Robin in the hearts of its fans.

Or if he dies then at least he would become more valuable to DC in death than he was in life. Batman would grieve this death for many issues. DC would earn a profit from that. As I said DC gambled away Todd’s life because it didn’t matter to them if he lives or dies. People had already decided. Jason Todd died a gruesome death at the hands of Joker because of a close **72-vote** margin. **5,343** votes to **5,271**. More than 5 thousand people voted to see a teenager get tortured and die. In a comic book.

**Take a moment to think about the cruelty in the world.**

Next thing you know, DC and Batman have replaced him with yet another Robin – Tim Drake. And this time there is no hate mail. No despise. People love Tim Drake. For some people, he already was the favourite Robin. For years many people would research reasons why Todd was hated and Drake was loved. The answers have not yet convinced me.

What happened to Jason was **unfair**. The circumstances of it were **unfair**. But most of all, the anger and fans had for him during his tenure as Robin was **unfair**.

**The RESURRECTION**

Till this part of the story, Jason is still a **victim**. But that changed when he came back.

![](https://fortressofinsights.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/evolution-of-jason-todd-1.jpg) I can’t say for sure how Jason Todd was resurrected. There are many conflicting ideas in comics. All I know is what he saw after he was resurrected. It changed him. made him question the life he had led.

Batman had replaced him with another Robin – Tim Drake. Joker’s crime spree still continued. Batman didn’t even change his methods. He interfered with the due process of the law. Let criminals go to a prison/mental institution which they have escaped dozens of times in the past. Put teenage children in dangerous combat situations. These are all bad decisions which Batman still follows.

**I know,right? Also, Batman is the most popular hero of the world. Now take a moment to think about the insanity in the world.**

Jason was not angry with Bruce because he lit him die. He was mad because his death was not avenged. It was proof that there was something wrong with how Batman operated and Bruce did nothing. Now that may not be true, but that’s how Jason saw it. And in a way he is right. But I am not defending Jason Todd especially he was just revived from death by Lazarus Pits. (They can make anyone go crazy insane and murderous) I am just telling you that that was the day **Red Hood** was born.

**Pain and Vendetta**

If you have been fighting your whole life,

if you were fighting even in death and rebirth.

Then the reason you fight is not the one you keep telling yourself.

It’s the one you feel ashamed to even admit to yourself.

-Me (2020)

I am not going to talk about what happened with Red Hood in detail. This post was about Jason Todd, not Red Hood. I am going to jump to the present day and tell you the conclusion.

So here are highlights for the part I will skip.

Red Hood comes back. Becomes A Brutal Vigilante.

Fans don’t like that.

Batman dies. Nightwing becomes Batman. Jason becomes a proper villain. Fall to the Dark Side.

(Real mature to throw tantrums. Daddy didn’t avenge me, I will kill criminals.)

Fans don’t like that.

DC gets rebooted a couple times. Red Hood is now an anti-villain. No more murderous. Maybe even a renegade hero.

Fans are sort of OK with it.

It sounds more stupid than it actually is. It’s actually really engaging to read.

**How is Jason Now?**

Right now in comics, we know that the relationship between Bruce and Jason is strained. He may be a member of the Bat-family now but none of his brothers like him. Batman and Red Hood don’t see eye-to-eye on each other’s methods.

Over the years we have seen many possible futures in DC. They show who will wear the Cowl of Batman after Bruce Wayne.

Sometimes it’s Dick Grayson. Sometimes Tim Drake. Even the arrogant son – Damian Wayne is Batman in one storyline. Right now, DC Future State shows that Tim Fox – the second son of Lucius Fox will be the next Batman.

But none of these stories ever say that Jason Todd may be the Batman of future. No matter how many times he redeems himself. No matter what he sacrifices or pains he endure. Even if a zombie apocalypse kills the entire Bat-family, DC will make Damian Wayne Batman before they even consider Jason. They won’t even let him join the Justice League. Or Justice Society. Not even the Suicide Squad.

This is the dark consequence of that vote. A destiny destroyed.

No family. No friends. No future. Just a saint of a father who will always treat him with disappointment. Jason Todd: Batman’s biggest failure. Criminal in a House of Heroes.

No redemption. No respect.

Only Regrets.

History would be a lot different if something along the way would have changed. Maybe if DC would have shown some mercy. Or maybe Batman would have reached in time.

Ironically, most fans (including me) prefer this current version of Jason. A lot of tragedies, bad decisions and hate mail of fans may have led us here.

But no one today can say that **Jason Todd** is yet another ex-Robin who grew under the shadow of Batman. And maybe he would never be Batman. Some paths are made, others are **carved**.

Maybe Jason-who-never-died may have become a formidable hero. Or maybe he would have joined a team of Teen Titans early in life and become a D-List superhero for life(uh, that means ‘a really insignificant side character’ in superhero language!)

I hate what happened. But it happened more than 40 years ago. I have accepted who Jason is today. On some days I even admire him. Red Hood is not the hero every kid should look up to growing up. He is not the hero whose signal in the sky gives Gotham hope. But he sure as hell is one whose presence strikes fear in the minds of Gotham criminals. And that is enough.

Acceptance. Never live a day in life with regrets. Life will always be uncertain. Your decisions today may change your fate forever. Think about them. Make them. But never **regret** them.

**What you resist, persists.**

**What you accept, transforms.**

On that positive note, I leave you all. Like, subscribe and share for more content from Fortress Of Insights. Tell me what you think about Jason Todd in the comments. I will be back next time with more insights and awesome stories to tell.
